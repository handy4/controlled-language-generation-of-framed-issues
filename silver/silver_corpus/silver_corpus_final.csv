Depending where you live those pills go for anywhere from $0.50 - $1.00 a mg. but some places are even higher .. you see some people here sellin Oxy 80'S for $100.00 .. Thats insane as far as I am concerned .. You could never get more then $45 - 47 for an 80 here .. but supply and demand right .. your buyers NEED these pills so will pay almost anything .. but dont take advantage of them my friend .. they will pay it but they will hate your guts .. and given the choice they would most likely love to drop your name to a cop to get you back.	smoking	0.0003406381287612	1	0.9857997894287108

HONOLULU (CNS) — An Oahu pro-life pregnancy resource center and a national network of pregnancy resource centers have filed a federal lawsuit to halt the enforcement of a new Hawaii law that requires such centers to “advertise” contraception and abortion “services.”
Attorneys for Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal group that supports religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and other issues, filed the suit July 12 on behalf of a Calvary Chapel Pearl Harbor center called A Place for Women, and the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which represents most of Hawaii’s five other pregnancy counseling centers."	abortion	0.0135135135135135	5	0.9934098124504088
The question of whether it would be “blasphemy” to suppose that “we have more of love in our Nature” than God has in His compels speculation upon that condition in which the question ceases to agonize, not because an answer has been found that confirms the poet either in misplaced piety or in proud damnation, but because in such a condition “love” would cease to be that negative extension by which we learn we are at present as divorced from “all sentient beings” as we are from ourselves as children, and instead be the “exalted” condition of heaven on earth.	immigration	0.0001043187982474	3	0.5546714067459106

Back in the late 50’s a buddy of mine managed to locate and buy a p-40 and flew it almost as a daily driver….the maintenance had to be horrible…every time I watched him take off out of Deer Valley North of Phoenix, his gear would twist around and fold into the wings, strange but I noted the Grumman Hellcat also had that weird retraction action…..anyway, it seemed to work OK……
